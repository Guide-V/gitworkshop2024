# Hello World!!

## Continuous Integration (CI) ?
Continuous integration involves developers
integrating their work regularly, typically on a
daily basis, to quickly detect bugs and reduce the
time needed for validating and releasing
software updates.

## Continuous Delivery (CD) ?
Continuous Delivery ensures that whenever a
developer makes changes to the code, it is
integrated, built, and automatically tested in
environments resembling production. This
process provides valuable feedback from tests in
each environment, allowing developers to
pinpoint and resolve issues before deploying the
code to production
